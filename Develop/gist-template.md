# Title 
Walk Through of Regex- Guide to Validating Email Addresses
## Introductory paragraph 
Welcome to 'Walk Through of Regex- Guide to Validating Email Addresses' — a tutorial designed to spell out one of the most useful, yet often intimidating tools in a developer's toolbox.
 Regular expressions- Regular expressions, commonly known as Regex, are a series of characters that form a search pattern. When applied in programming, they provide a flexible and efficient means of matching strings of text, such as email addresses, with precision and speed. In this tutorial, we'll dissect the anatomy of Regex used for email validation, offering clear explanations and practical examples. By the end of this guide, you'll not only understand how to use Regex to validate email addresses but also appreciate the elegance and power of Regex patterns in everyday coding

## Summary
In this tutorial, we delve into the world of regular expressions—a method for describing patterns in text that allows for sophisticated searching, matching, and data manipulation. At the heart of our discussion is the following regex pattern used for email validation:

```Regex-
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

This pattern is a staple in web development, as it ensures that user input conforms to the structure of a valid email address. We will explore each segment of this Regex, from the circumflex that marks the beginning, to the dollar sign that signifies the end, demystifying its syntax and demonstrating its utility. You will learn how the Regex matches the local part of an email before the '@' symbol, ensures a valid domain follows, and checks for a proper top-level domain. By understanding each component, you'll gain the ability to tailor this Regex for different requirements or even craft your own patterns for other validation needs. Join us as we unpack the building blocks of this Regex, providing you with the knowledge to harness the full potential of regular expressions in your projects.

## Break Down
### 1. The Caret (^) and Dollar Sign ($)

The caret symbolizes the start of the string, and the dollar sign is the end of the string. This means that the Regex pattern must match the entire string from start to finish, not just a part of it.

### 2. Matching the Local Part of an Email

([a-z0-9_\.-]+) This matches the local part of the email address (before the @). To break down this down a little further:

Alphanumeric and Special Characters- The character class [a-z0-9_\.-] matches any lowercase letter, digit, underscore, period, or dash.
The Plus "+" Quantifier- The + means that the preceding character class must appear at least once, but can be repeated multiple times.

### 3. The At Symbol "@" and Domain Name

The "@" symbol is a literal character that must appear in the string exactly as it is. After that, ([\da-z\.-]+) matches the domain part of the email:

Domain Characters and Periods- Like the local part, this matches a sequence of digits, letters, periods, or dashes.

The Escape Character "\" - Explain that the escape character is used to allow special characters to be used in the Regex pattern without being interpreted in their special role.

### 4. The Top-Level Domain

The last part ([a-z\.]{2,6}) matches the top-level domain-

Curly Braces "{}" Quantification- The {2,6} quantifier means that the preceding character class must appear at least 2 times but no more than 6, which corresponds to the length of top-level domains.

Character Set for Top-Level Domain- The character set [a-z\.] allows for any lowercase letter and period, which accounts for the "dot" in ".com" and other domains.

## Examples

Examples and Test Cases

In this section, we will test our Regex pattern against various strings to see if they qualify as valid email addresses. Here are some examples.

### Positive Examples-

'example@email.com' matches because it follows the 'username@domain.tld' format with valid characters.

'user.name@sub.domain.com' matches, demonstrating that periods and subdomains are allowed.

'my-email@domain.co.uk' matches, showing that hyphens and two-part TLDs are acceptable.

Why They Match:

Each begins with one or more permitted characters- lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, or periods.
They contain a single @ symbol separating the local part from the domain part.
The domain part contains permitted characters and at least one period.
They conclude with a top-level domain between 2 to 6 letters in length.

### Negative Examples:

'plainaddress' does not match because it lacks the @ symbol and domain part.

'@missinglocal.com' does not match because the local part before the @ symbol is missing.

'me@.com' does not match because there is no domain name before the top-level domain.

'user@domain.a' does not match because the top-level domain is too short, being only one character.

Why They Don’t Match:

They do not conform to the structure defined by the regex pattern.
Essential components such as the @ symbol, local part, domain, or a valid TLD are missing or incorrect.
Edge Cases:

## Common Issues

### Overlooking Case Sensitivity:

Issue- Assuming Regex is case-insensitive when it's not specified. For example, [a-z] does not match uppercase letters unless you include the i flag or [A-Za-z].

### Misunderstanding Special Characters:

Issue- Special characters like the dot . or the plus + have specific meanings in Regex. For instance, . matches any character, so user.name@domain.com might not be validated correctly if the dot is not escaped.

### Incorrect Quantifier Usage:

Issue- Using the wrong quantifiers can lead to matching too much or too little. For example, using * instead of + could match an empty string before the @ symbol.

### Neglecting Top-Level Domain (TLD) Variations:

Issue- Not accounting for newer TLDs that are longer than the traditional two to six characters, such as .photography.

## Conclusion

Some key takeways  is regular expressions are a fundamental tool in the developer's toolbox, enabling the precise matching of patterns within text.
The structure of Regex patterns is logical and, with practice, becomes intuitive. Remember to consider the start and end anchors, character classes, quantifiers, and the literal characters in your patterns.
Common issues can often be mitigated by a thorough understanding of regex syntax and behavior, and by testing against a wide range of data.
As with any skill, proficiency in regex comes with practice and experience. I encourage you to take the regex patterns you've learned here and apply them to your projects. Experiment with modifying the patterns, testing them with different inputs, and observing the outcomes.

Thank you for following along, and happy coding!


## About Me

Hello and thank you for reading! My name is Drew Ledford, and I'm currently in the challenging yet rewarding world of a full stack web development bootcamp through the University of Texas. At 38, I took the jump into the land of coding with no prior background in this field, driven by a firm belief that it's never too late to learn something new or to change one's career path.

I started on this journey with the goal to not only understand the basics  of web development—from the front-end frameworks to the deep back-end systems—but also to apply this knowledge in building applications that make a difference. Each day is an opportunity to solve puzzles, to create, and to move one step closer to becoming a successful coder.

I am thrilled about the power of education and the transformation it brings. Through my bootcamp experience, I've learned that perseverance, curiosity, and the willingness to ask questions are as important as the technical skills themselves. As I continue to grow in this field, I aspire to develop not just code, but solutions that are impactful and meaningful.

If you're curious about my journey or my projects, feel free to connect with me on GitHub at [Github](https://github.com/Drew-Odinson). Let's continue to learn and grow together in this ever-growing world of web development.
